    /*Exercise 1: Factorial

These exercises will help you understand and master recursion in JavaScript ‚Äî solving problems by having a function call itself.
‚úÖ Instructions

    Do not use loops (for, while, etc.)
    Each solution must use pure recursion
    Focus on defining a base case and a recursive case
    Use console.log() to test your results
